# Correction of the TP API-POO

Here's the correction of the API-POO TP

## Concepts

Here is a corrected memo on the definition of some of the concepts covered in this tutorial.

### Class

Classes are molds, patterns that enable you to create objects in series based on the same model. You can think of a class as the construction diagram and list of functionalities for a set of objects

> Just as the construction of a house requires a plan, so does an object

### Object

An object represents a concept, an idea or any entity in the physical world, such as a car, a person or a page in a book

> An e-commerce site selling shoes will have a shoe object representation with a "Shoe" class that instantiates the "Shoe" object ðŸ¥¾

### Instantiation

Instantiation is a concept that involves creating an object using a class

> The object is the thing we want to represent in our application while the class is the blueprint to create it. Instantiation is the way we create it based on it class ðŸ˜Š

### Singleton

Singleton is a creation design pattern that guarantees that a class instance exists in a single copy, while providing a global access point to that instance

> In our API we used a Singleton to have only one instance of our Database class while we provide global access in the DatabaseConnector script ðŸ”¥
